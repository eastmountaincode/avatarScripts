Water.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.
Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.
Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.
But when the world needed him most, he vanished.
A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang.
And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.
Oof!
But I believe Aang can save the world.
Line 'em up for the warden!
Dad.
Excuse me, coming through!
The warden wants me over there, sorry!
Welcome to the Boiling Rock.
I'm sure you've all heard the horrible rumors about our little island.
Well, I just want to tell you that they don't have to be true, as long as you do everything I say.
Look me in the eye when I'm talking to you.
No.
Oh, you'd rather look at my shoes?
Then take a look!
Aah!
I know exactly who you are, Hakoda of the Water Tribe.
So strong-willed.
But don't worry. We'll get rid of that in time.
Now look me in the eye!
See, isn't that better?
You will all do as I say or pay the price.
You will always...
Are you okay, sir? I'm fine!
Get these prisoners out of my sight.
Thank goodness you're okay!
If you take one step closer, you'll see just how okay I am.
Dad, it's me.
Sokka?
My son.
You know, Sokka, you should be more careful with that guard outfit on.
I almost punched you in the gut.
Yeah, I ran into that problem earlier.
Are you comfortable, Chit Sang?
If you're trying to get me to talk, forget it!
I'm not a squealer.
Chit Sang, I only ask you if you were comfortable.
Well, yeah, actually, I am pretty comfortable.
Are you still comfortable?
No.
I know you and your cronies are not smart enough to come up with that little escape plan.
So you're gonna tell me who is.
So where's Bato?
Where's everyone else from the invasion?
The others are being held at a prison near the Fire Nation palace.
They singled me out as their leader and sent me here.
But before I left, I met some young women who said they knew you.
The Oshinama Fighters?
You mean the Kyoshi Warriors? That's right.
Their leader, Suki, is here, and she's gonna escape with us.
Good, we'll need all the help we can get.
And you know Prince Zuko? The son of the Fire Lord?
I don't know him, but I know of him.
Well, he's here, too. Sounds like a major problem.
Actually, he's on our side now.
I know, I had the same reaction.
After all he's done, it was hard to trust him.
But he's really proven himself, and I never would've found you without his help.
So, do you have a plan?
We had one, but some of the other prisoners got involved and ruined it.
I don't know if there's another way off this island.
Sokka, there's no prison in the world that can hold two Water Tribe geniuses.
Then we better find two.
Zuko, are you there?
I'm here.
I just got done talking to my dad.
We came up with an escape plan together.
What are you doing here?
I was just telling this dirty lowlife what I think of him!
Well, you'll have to do that later.
He's coming with us.
Why?
Because we have orders straight from the warden, that's why.
Could I just get 10 more seconds to rough him up a bit?
Fine, 10 seconds.
Take that! And this!
Newbie!
We have a new plan, but it's gonna need a big distraction.
Be in the yard in one hour.
All right, that's enough.
What are you doing? Where are you taking me?
Aah! I didn't do anything wrong.
Come on, Zuko. We all know that's a lie.
Mai.
How is he? I think he's ready to talk.
Have you had enough time to think about what I asked?
Yes. And?
You're right.
There was another person involved in the escape plan.
Who?
It's a guy who's disguised like a prison guard, only he's not a prison guard.
He's the mastermind. He came up with the plan.
How did you know I was here? Because I know you so well.
But how...
The warden's my uncle, you idiot.
The truth is, I guess I don't know you.
All I get is a letter?
You could've at least looked me in the eye when you ripped out my heart.
I didn't mean to... You didn't mean to?
"Dear Mai, I'm sorry that you have to find out this way, "but I'm leaving."
Stop! This isn't about you!
This is about the Fire Nation.
Thanks, Zuko. That makes me feel all better.
Mai, I never wanted to hurt you.
But I have to do this to save my country.
Save it? You're betraying your country.
That's not how I see it.
Sokka, what's going on? I don't have much time.
If I'm seen with you, the guards might think something's up.
I just talked to my dad. That's great.
Yeah, and we're escaping today... on the gondola.
What?
My dad and I came up with the plan together.
We're gonna commandeer the gondola and we're gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines.
We'll never make it on to the gondola.
There's too many guards.
My dad already thought of that.
He said we'll need a distraction.
That's why we're gonna start a prison riot.
Okay, let's say by some miracle this all works and we make it on the gondola.
The warden will still just cut the lines even if we have a captive.
Not if the warden is the captive.
I have to go.
I'll find you before we start the riot.
Hey, you! The warden wants to see you!
Why?
I don't know. I didn't ask.
Maybe I could schedule another time with him?
How's tomorrow?
He wants to see you now.
Put him in the lineup.
One of you is an imposter who thought he could fool me.
But now that person is going to be in a lot of trouble.
Who is it?
That's him, Warden. He's the imposter!
What?
I am not!
He's lying! He's a liar!
I'm telling you, it wasn't me. Save your breath.
I know you've been working together.
You threw Chit Sang in the very cooler they used to escape.
It was all part of your plan.
That was just a coincidence!
Sir, there's someone to see you.
Who told you to interrupt me?
I did.
Princess Azula!
Uh, it is an honor to welcome you to the Fire Nation's most exemplary prison.
I didn't realize you were coming.
Who is this?
He's a guard who was involved in a recent and feeble escape attempt.
It wasn't me! Quiet, you!
You're wasting your time. That's not one of them.
How do you know? Because I'm a people person.
Hey, I just got orders.
Let the prisoners out into the yard.
But we're in the middle of lockdown.
Oh, okay.
I'll just go tell the warden you said that.
I'm sure he'll be glad to hear about you undermining his authority.
What's your name again?
Wait, uh, don't tell the warden.
I'm just a little confused.
Hey, I'm confused, too.
But the warden's in a bad mood and irrational.
So if you ask me, it's best not to question it and just do what he says.
Yeah, you're right.
We're letting them out!
This is it. We have to start a riot.
Okay, but how do we do that?
I'll show you.
Hey! What did you do that for?
That hurt my feelings.
Aren't you mad at me?
Uh, well, normally I would be, but I've been learning to control my anger.
This isn't working.
Hey, you!
You're lucky I didn't rat you out.
But my generosity comes with a price.
I know you're planning another escape attempt, and I want in.
Actually, we're trying to escape right now, but we need a riot.
You wouldn't happen to know how to start one, would you?
A prison riot? Please.
Hey! Riot!
Impressive.
Forget about controlling my anger.
Let's riot! Whoa!
Who let these prisoners into the yard?
This is supposed to be a lockdown!
Ma'am, there's a riot going on.
I'm here to protect you.
I don't need any protection. Heh, believe me, she doesn't.
I'm sorry, but I'm under direct orders from your uncle to make sure nothing happens.
Get off of me!
Zuko, good. We're all here.
Now, all we need to do is grab the warden and get to the gondolas.
And how do we do that?
I'm not sure.
Ugh, I thought you'd thought this through!
I thought you told me it's okay not to think everything through!
Maybe not everything, but this is kind of important.
Hey, uh, fellas?
I think your girlfriend's taking care of it.
You wouldn't dare.
Sorry, Warden. You're my prisoner now.
We've got the warden. Now let's get out of here.
That's some girl. Tell me about it.
We're almost there.
Back off! We've got the warden.
Let's go.
Everyone in.
What are you doing?
I'm making it so they can't stop us.
Way to think ahead.
We're on our way. Wait, who's that?
That's a problem.
It's my sister and her friend.
This is a rematch I've been waiting for.
Me too.
There's the warden.
I see him!
Cut the line!
He wants us to cut the line.
But if we cut the line, there's no way he'll survive.
He knows that.
They're about to cut the line!
Then it's time to leave.
Goodbye, Zuko.
They're cutting the line! The gondola's about to go!
I hope this thing floats.
What are you doing?
Saving the jerk who dumped me.
Whoa!
Who is that?
It's Mai.
What is she doing?
Sorry, Warden.
Your record is officially broken.
Well, we made it out. Now what?
Zuko, what are you doing? My sister was on that island.
Yeah, and she's probably right behind us, so let's not stop.
What I mean is she must've come here somehow.
There! That's our way out of here.
Leave us alone.
I never expected this from you.
The thing I don't understand is why.
Why would you do it? You know the consequences.
I guess you just don't know people as well as you think you do.
You miscalculated.
I love Zuko more than I fear you.
No, you miscalculated! You should've feared me more!
Come on! Let's get outta here!
You're both fools!
What shall we do with them, Princess?
Put them somewhere I'll never have to see their faces again, and let them rot!
What are you doing in this thing?
What happened to the war balloon?
It kinda got destroyed.
Sounds like a crazy fishing trip.
Did you at least get some good meat?
I did, the best meat of all.
The meat of friendship and fatherhood.
I'm new. What's up, everybody?
Dad.
Hi, Katara.
How are you here?
What is going on? Where did you go?
We kind of went to a Fire Nation prison.
Seriously, you guys didn't find any meat?
