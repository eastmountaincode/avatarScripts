KATARA: Water.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.
Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.
Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.
But when the world needed him most, he vanished.
100 years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang.
And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.
AANG: Oof.
KATARA: But I believe Aang can save the world.
[CHIRPS]
[GASPS]
Waterbending bomb! Yeah!
[SPLASH]
[ICE SHATTERS]
[LAUGHING]
Sure, 5,000-year-old maps from the Spirit Library.
Just splash some water on them.
Sorry.
[BIRDS CHIRPING]
So did you figure out what route we're gonna take?
SOKKA: Okay, we just got out of the desert, so we must be around here.
And we need to go to Ba Sing Se, which is here.
It looks like the only passage connecting the south to the north is this sliver of land called the Serpent's Pass.
-You're sure that's the best way to go? -It's the only way.
I mean, it's not like we have Appa to fly us there.
Shush up about Appa.
Can't you at least try to be sensitive?
Katara, it's okay.
I know I was upset about losing Appa before, but I just want to focus on getting to Ba Sing Se and telling the Earth King about the solar eclipse.
Oh, well, okay. I'm glad you're doing better.
Then to Ba Sing Se we go. No more distractions.
Hello there, fellow refugees!
So are you guys headed to Ba Sing Se too?
Sure are.
We're trying to get there before my wife, Ying, has her baby.
Great. We can travel through the Serpent's Pass together.
The Serpent's Pass?
Only the truly desperate take that deadly route.
Deadly route? Great pick, Sokka!
Well, we are desperate.
You should come with us to Full Moon Bay.
Ferries take refugees across the lake.
It's the fastest way to Ba Sing Se.
And it's hidden so the Fire Nation can't find it.
Hmm, peaceful ferry ride or deadly pass?
I can't believe how many people's lives have been uprooted by the Fire Nation.
We're all looking for a better life...
[BABY CRIES]
...safe behind the walls of Ba Sing Se.
Who would've thought after all these years I'd return to the scene of my greatest military disgrace as a tourist?
Look around.
We're not tourists. We're refugees.
Ugh!
I'm sick of eating rotten food, sleeping in the dirt.
I'm tired of living like this.
JET: Aren't we all?
My name's Jet, and these are my Freedom Fighters, Smellerbee and Longshot.
Hey.
Hello.
Here's the deal.
I hear the captain's eating like a king while all us refugees have to feed off his scraps.
Doesn't seem fair, does it?
What sort of king is he eating like?
The fat, happy kind.
You wanna help us liberate some food?
-[SPLASHES] -I'm in.
I told you already, no vegetables on the ferry!
One cabbage slug could destroy the entire ecosystem of Ba Sing Se!
-Security! -Aah!
[GROWLS]
Gah, my cabbages!
[SOBS]
Next!
Um, four tickets for the ferry to Ba Sing Se, please.
Passports?
Uh, no one told us we had to have passports.
Don't you know who this is? He's the Avatar.
Ah, I see 50 Avatars a day.
And by the way, not a very impressive costume.
[SQUAWKS]
Besides, no animals allowed. Do I need to call security?
[BURPS]
[SQUEAKS AND TRILLS]
That won't be necessary.
-Next! -I'll take care of this.
My name is Toph Beifong and I need four tickets.
Ah, the golden seal of the flying boar.
It is my pleasure to help anyone of the Beifong family.
It is your pleasure.
As you can see, I am blind and these three imbeciles are my valets.
-But the animal... -Is my seeing-eye lemur.
[CHATTERS]
Well, normally it's only one ticket per passport, but this document is so official, I guess it's worth four tickets.
Thank you very much.
All right! We scammed that lady good!
Aah!
-Tickets and passports, please. -Is there a problem?
Yeah, I got a problem with you.
I've seen your type before.
Probably sarcastic, think you're hilarious.
And let me guess, you're traveling with the Avatar.
Do I know you?
You mean you don't remember? Maybe you remember this.
Suki!
Sokka, it's good to see you!
KATARA: You look so different without your makeup and the new outfit.
That crabby lady makes all the security guards wear them.
And look at you, sleeveless guy. Been working out?
Oh, I'll grab a tree branch and do a few chin touches every now and then. Nothing major.
Are the other Kyoshi Warriors around?
Yeah. After you left Kyoshi, we wanted to find a way to help people.
We ended up escorting some refugees, and we've been here ever since.
-[CHATTERS] -[LAUGHS]
Hi, Momo. Good to see you too.
[TRILLS]
So why are you guys getting tickets for the ferry?
Wouldn't you just fly across on Appa?
Appa is missing.
We hope to find him in Ba Sing Se.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Are you doing okay?
I'm doing fine.
Would everybody stop worrying about me?
Avatar Aang, you have to help us!
Someone took all of our belongings, our passports, our tickets. Everything's gone!
[SOBS]
I'll talk to the lady for you.
No passports, no tickets!
But she's pregnant, and all their stuff was stolen.
You have to make an exception.
No exceptions!
If I just gave away tickets willy-nilly to anyone, there would be no more order.
And you know what that means... No more civilization!
What if we gave them our tickets?
-No! -But...
-Next! -[SPITS]
Don't worry, you'll get to the city safely.
I'll lead you through the Serpent's Pass.
I can't believe we gave up our tickets and now we're going through the Serpent's Pass.
I can't believe you're still complaining about it.
I'm coming too!
Are you sure that's a good idea?
Sokka, I thought you'd want me to come.
I do. It's just...
Just what?
Nothing. I'm glad you're coming.
This is the Serpent's Pass?
I thought it would be more wind-y.
You know, like a serpent. Hmm, I guess they misnamed it.
Look at this writing. How awful.
What does it say?
It says, "Abandon hope."
How could we abandon hope? That's all we have.
AANG: I don't know.
The monks used to say that hope is just a distraction.
So maybe we do need to abandon it.
What are you talking about?
Hope isn't going to get us into Ba Sing Se, and it's not gonna find Appa.
We need to focus on what we're doing right now, and that's getting across this pass.
Okay, if you say so.
SUKI: The Fire Nation controls the Western Lake.
Rumor has it they're working on something big on the other side and they don't want anyone to find out what it is.
Whoa!
[GROANS]
I'm okay!
[RUMBLING]
[SPLASH]
They spotted us!
Let's go! Let's go!
[BLASTS]
[GASPS]
Suki, are you okay?
You have to be more careful! Come on!
Thanks for saving my life, Toph.
Hey, no problem, Sokka.
Suki, you shouldn't sleep there.
Who knows how stable this ledge is?
It could give way at any moment.
Sokka, I'm fine. Stop worrying!
You're right, you're right.
You're perfectly capable of taking care of yourself.
Wait!
Oh, never mind. I thought I saw a spider. But you're fine.
SMELLERBEE: Guard's coming!
You know, it's okay to miss Appa.
What's going on with you?
In the desert, all you cared about was finding Appa.
And now it's like you don't care about him at all.
You saw what I did out there.
I was so angry about losing Appa, I couldn't control myself.
I hated feeling like that.
But now you're not letting yourself feel anything.
I know sometimes it hurts more to hope, and it hurts more to care.
But you have to promise me that you won't stop caring.
Come on, you need a hug.
AANG: Thank you for you concern, Katara.
-It's a beautiful moon. -Yeah, it really is.
Look, I know you're just trying to help, but I can take care of myself.
I know you can.
Then why are you acting so overprotective?
It's so hard to lose someone you care about.
Something happened at the North Pole and I couldn't protect someone.
I don't want anything like that to ever happen again.
I lost someone I cared about.
He didn't die. He just went away.
I only had a few days to get to know him, but he was smart, and brave, and funny.
Who is this guy? Is he taller than me?
No, he's about your height.
-Is he better-looking? -It is you, stupid!
Oh.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
No, you shouldn't be.
So, Smellerbee.
That's an unusual name for a young man.
Maybe it's because I'm not a man.
I'm a girl!
Oh, now I see!
It's a beautiful name for a lovely girl!
I know. You're right.
As long as I'm confident with who I am, it doesn't matter what other people think.
Thanks, Longshot.
[SLURPING]
From what I heard, people eat like this every night in Ba Sing Se.
I can't wait to set my eyes on that giant wall.
It is a magnificent sight.
So you've been there before?
Once, when I was a different man.
I've done some things in my past that I'm not proud of.
But that's why I'm going to Ba Sing Se, for a new beginning, a second chance.
That's very noble of you.
I believe people can change their lives if they want to.
I believe in second chances.
[MOMO TRILLS]
Everyone single file!
[WATER RUSHING]
KATARA: Aang, I need help!
[CHATTERS]
[FRIGHTENED CHATTER]
What is that thing?
[GASPING]
[SCREAMING]
[SPLASH]
[ROARS]
I think I just figured out why they call it the Serpent's Pass!
[ROARS]
[ROARS]
Suki, you know about giant sea monsters.
Make it go away!
Just because I live near the Unagi doesn't mean I'm an expert!
Oh great and powerful sea serpent, please accept this humble and tasty offering.
-Thank you. -Sokka!
[SCREECHES]
I'll distract it. Katara, get everyone across.
[ROARS]
[SERPENT ROARS]
[ROARS]
[SCREECHES]
[SCREECHES]
[ROARS]
[SCREECHES]
Toph, come on! It's just ice!
Actually, I'm gonna stay on my little island where I can see.
[SCREECHES]
Aah! Okay, I'm coming!
SOKKA: You're doing great!
Just follow the sound of my voice.
It's hard to ignore.
SOKKA: You're almost there!
-[SERPENT ROARS] -[SCREAMS]
Help! I can't swim!
SOKKA: I'm coming, Toph!
[SERPENT SCREECHES]
-[PANTING] -Help!
[BUBBLING]
[GASPS]
Oh, Sokka, you saved me!
Mwah!
Actually, it's me.
Oh, well. [CHUCKLES]
You can go ahead and let me drown now.
[ROARS]
[SCREECHES]
[SCREECHES]
ALL: Yeah!
There's the wall!
Now it's nothing but smooth sailing to Ba Sing Se.
[GASPS] Oh no!
What's wrong?
The baby's coming.
What? Now?
Can't you hold it in or something?
Sokka, calm down.
I helped Gran Gran deliver lots of babies back home.
This isn't the same as delivering an arctic seal!
This a real... Human... Thing!
It's called a baby.
And I've helped her deliver plenty of those too.
Aang, get some rags. Sokka, water.
Toph, I need you to make an earth tent... A big one.
Suki, come with me.
You know, as soon as I saw your scar, I knew exactly who you were.
You're an outcast, like me.
And us outcasts have to stick together.
We have to watch each other's backs, because no one else will.
I've realized lately that being on your own isn't always the best path.
[PANTING]
You're doing great, Ying. Sokka, where's that water?
Now get ready to push. One, two, three, push!
[YING GROANS]
[BABY CRYING]
KATARA: It's a girl!
So, you wanna go see the baby or are you going to faint like an old lady again?
No, no. I'm good this time.
Aang, you have to come see this.
[BABY CRYING]
-She sounds healthy. -She's beautiful.
And so squishy-looking.
What should we name her?
I want our daughter's name to be unique.
I want it to mean something.
I've been going through a really hard time lately.
But you've made me hopeful again.
I know what I want to name our baby now.
Hope.
That's a perfect name. Hope.
I thought I was trying to be strong.
But really I was just running away from my feelings.
Seeing this family together, so full of happiness and love, it's reminding me how I feel about Appa...
...and how I feel about you.
I promise, I'll find Appa as fast as I can.
I just really need to do this.
See you in the big city.
Say hi to that big fuzzball for me.
-You'll find him, Aang. -I know.
Thank you, Katara.
[CHATTERS]
-You ready, Momo? -[CHATTERS]
[CHATTERS]
Sokka, it's been really great to see you again.
Whoa, hold on.
Why does it sound like you're saying goodbye?
I came along because I wanted to make sure you got through the Serpent's Pass safely.
But now I need to get back to the other Kyoshi Warriors.
So you came along to protect me?
Listen, I'm really sorry about last night.
We were talking and saying things...
I just got carried away and before I knew it, I...
You talk too much.
[MOMO CHATTERS]
[CHATTERS]
[CHATTERS]
[GASPS]
Sorry, Momo. Appa's gonna have to wait.
[DRILL WHIRRING]
[DRILL WHIRRING]
[STEAM HISSING]
[CREAKING]
[WHIRRING]
This drill is a feat of scientific ingenuity and raw destructive power.
Once it tunnels through the wall, our troops will storm their city.
The Earth Kingdom will finally fall.
And you can claim Ba Sing Se in the name of your father.
Nothing can stop us.
Hmm, what about those muscle-y guys down there?
[DRILL WHIRRING]
Please, the drill's metal shell is impervious to any earthbending attack.
Oh, I'm sure it is, War Minister Qin.
But just to be on the safe side, Mai and Ty Lee, take the Earthbenders out.
Finally, something to do.
[MOMO CHATTERS]
Aang, what are you doing here? I thought you were looking for Appa.
I was, but something stopped me... Something big.
SOKKA: Now, what's so big that Appa has to wait?
AANG: That.
[DRILL WHIRRING]
We made it to Ba Sing Se and we're still not safe.
No one is.
What are you people doing here?
Civilians aren't allowed on the wall.
I'm the Avatar. Take me to whoever's in charge.
It is an honor to welcome you to the Outer Wall, young Avatar.
But your help is not needed.
-Not needed? -Not needed.
I have the situation under control.
I assure you, the Fire Nation cannot penetrate this wall.
Many have tried to break through it, but none have succeeded.
What about the Dragon of the West? He got in.
Well, technically, yes. But he was quickly expunged.
Nevertheless, that's why the city is named Ba Sing Se.
It's the impenetrable city.
They don't call it Na Sing Se!
[LAUGHS] That means penetrable city.
Yeah, thanks for the tour.
But we still got the drill problem.
Not for long.
To stop it, I've sent an elite platoon of Earthbenders called the Terra Team.
That's a good group name. Very catchy.
[GRUNTING]
[RUMBLING]
Ready? Attack!
[CREAKING]
[GRUNTING]
[GRUNTS]
[GRUNTS]
[GRUNTING]
[GROANS]
We're doomed!
Get a hold of yourself, man!
You're right. I'm sorry.
Maybe you'd like the Avatar's help now?
[MEEKLY] Yes, please.
So the question is, how are we gonna stop that thing?
-Why are you all looking at me? -You're the idea guy.
So I'm the only one who could ever come up with a plan?
That's a lot of pressure.
-And also, the complaining guy. -That part I don't mind.
So, Mr. Lee and Mister, um... "Mushy," is it?
It's pronounced "Moo-shi."
You telling me how to do my job?
Uh, no, no, no.
But may I just say, you're like a flower in bloom.
Your beauty's intoxicating.
Mmm, you're pretty easy on the eyes yourself, handsome.
Rawr!
Welcome to Ba Sing Se.
I'm gonna forget I saw that.
I think Lee would make a good Freedom Fighter.
He's just trying to find his way in the world, like us.
You don't know anything about him, Jet.
I know he didn't get that scar from a Waterbender.
Besides, I thought we were going straight now.
We are. And the new Freedom Fighters could use a guy like Lee.
What do you think, Longshot?
I can respect that.
What's wrong with him? He doesn't look injured.
His qi is blocked.
-Who did this to you? -Two girls ambushed us.
One of them hit me with a bunch of quick jabs.
And suddenly, I couldn't earthbend, and I could barely move. And then she cartwheeled away.
Ty Lee. She doesn't look dangerous, but she knows the human body and its weak points.
It's like she takes you down from the inside.
-Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! -Yes?
What you just said.
That's how we're gonna take down the drill...
The same way Ty Lee took down all these big Earthbenders.
By hitting its pressure points!
We'll take it down from the inside.
[DRILL WHIRRING]
Once I whip up some cover, you're not gonna be able to see, so stay close to me.
[RUMBLING]
TOPH: Run!
[MOMO CHATTERS]
Hey, look at that dust cloud.
It's so... Poofy. Poof!
Don't worry, Princess. I'm sure it's nothing.
[DRILL WHIRRING]
[RUMBLING]
Everyone into the hole.
SOKKA: It's so dark down here. I can't see a thing.
TOPH: [SARCASTICALLY] Oh, no, what a nightmare!
SOKKA: Sorry.
[DRILL WHIRRING]
There.
[MOMO CHATTERS]
[GRUNTS]
[GRUNTS]
Toph, come on!
No way am I going in that metal monster.
I can't bend in there.
I'll try to slow it down out here.
Okay, good luck.
[RUMBLING]
[GRUNTS]
I need a plan of this machine, some schematics that show what the inside looks like.
Then we can find its weak points.
Where are we gonna get something like that?
[CLANG]
What are you doing? Someone's gonna hear us.
That's the point.
I figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it.
-And when something breaks... -They come to fix it.
[GAS HISSING]
Hi.
This'll work, thanks!
[CLANGS]
It looks like the drill is made up of two main structures.
There's the inner mechanism, where we are now, and the outer shell.
The inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces.
If we cut through them, the entire thing will collapse.
So, you guys got plans once you're inside the city?
MAN: Get your hot tea here! Finest tea in Ba Sing Se!
Oh, Jasmine, please!
[COUGHS]
Coldest tea in Ba Sing Se is more like it.
What a disgrace!
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
[SIGHS]
You and I have a much better chance of making it in the city if we stick together.
You wanna join the Freedom Fighters?
Thanks, but I don't think you want me in your gang.
Come on, we made a great team looting that captain's food.
Think of all the good we could do for these refugees.
I said no.
Have it your way.
[SLURPS]
Hey!
What are you doing firebending your tea?
For a wise old man, that was a pretty stupid move.
I know you're not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but...
-[SNIFFLES] It's just so sad! -[TRAGIC VIOLIN PLAYS]
[DRILL WHIRRING]
Wow, it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans.
We're gonna have to work pretty hard to cut through that.
What's this "we" stuff?
Aang and I are gonna have to do all the work.
Look, I'm the plan guy.
You two are the cut stuff up with waterbending guys.
Together, we're Team Avatar.
[METAL SLICING]
[PANTING]
Come on, team! Don't quit now!
-We're... -[GROWLS]
I mean, you're almost there!

At this rate, we won't do enough damage before the drill reaches the wall.
I don't know how many more of those I have in me.
[CREAKING]
[RUMBLING]
Do you hear that? We took it down!
We better get out of here fast.
QIN [ON PA]: Congratulations, crew!
The drill has made contact with the wall of Ba Sing Se.
Start the countdown to victory!
[CREW CHEERING]
[DRILL WHIRRING]
[DRILL WHIRRING]
[GRUNTS]
Come on, brace! Budge!
[GRUNTS]
This is bad. Really bad.
[PANTING] We're putting everything we've got into busting these braces, but it's taking too long!
Maybe we don't need to cut all the way through.
Toph has been teaching me that you shouldn't give 100% of your energy into any one strike.
Sokka, take a fighting stance.
You've gotta be quick and accurate.
Hit a series of points and break your opponent's stance.
And when he's reeling back, you deliver the final blow.
His own weight becomes his downfall, literally.
So we just need to weaken the braces instead of cutting all the way through.
Then I'll go to the top of this thing and deliver the final blow.
And boom, it all comes crashing down!
Everyone inside that wall, the whole world, is counting on us.
The whole world minus the Fire Nation, that is.
[GRUNTS]
Come on, Twinkle Toes! Hurry up!
[METAL SLICING]
That's enough! We need to get to the next one.
MAN [ON PA]: War Minister! An engineer was ambushed.
His schematics were stolen.
MAN [ON PA]: War Minister!
A brace on the starboard side has been cut clean through!
It's sabotage, sir!
Let's go, ladies.
-[SPLASHING] -[METAL SLICING]
Good work, Team Avatar.
Now Aang just needs to... Duck!
Whoa!
Wow, Azula, you were right! It is the Avatar...
...and friends.
Hey.
Aah!
Whoa!
[MOMO CHATTERS]
Guys, get out of here! I know what I need to do.
Wait, you need this water more than I do.
Follow them. The Avatar's mine.
Slurry pipeline?
-[GRUNTS] -What does that mean?
[GRUNTS]
It's rock and water mixed together.
It means our way out.

Ugh, disgusting.
Come on, you heard Azula. We have to follow them.
She can shoot all the lightning she wants at me.
I am not going in that wall sludge juice.

Then, when Aang delivers the final blow, it'll be ready to pop!
[RUMBLING]
[MOMO CHATTERS]
This looks like a good spot, Momo.

General Sung, tell your soldiers to stop shooting rocks down here!
Soldiers, whatever you do, don't stop shooting rocks down there!

Good technique, Little Sister. Keep it up!
Don't forget to breathe.
You know, I am just about sick and tired of you telling me what to do all day.

Jet, relax.
So the old guy had some hot tea. Big deal!
He heated it himself. Those guys are Firebenders.
-What a handsome baby. -Thank you.
SOKKA: I just wanted to say good effort out there today, Team Avatar.
Enough with the Team Avatar stuff.
No matter how many times you say it, it's not gonna catch on.
How about the Boomerang Squad?
See, it's good 'cause it's got "ang" in it.
Boomer-Aang!
I kinda like that one.
Let's talk about this on our way into the city.
-The Aang Gang? -KATARA: Sokka...
-The Fearsome Foursome! -TOPH: You're crazy.
Why? We're fearsome!
