Water.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.
Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.
Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.
But when the world needed him most, he vanished.
A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang.
And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.
Oof!
But I believe Aang can save the world.
Sokka's your name, right?
My favorite prisoner used to mention you all the time.
She was convinced you were going to come rescue her.
Of course, you never came, and she gave up on you.
Where is Suki?
How are we all gonna escape?
We're not. You kids have to leave.
You have to escape on Appa together.
Goodbye, Dad.
We won't be apart for too long this time. I promise.
No one can make tea like Uncle.
But, hopefully, I learned a thing or two.
Would you like to hear Uncle's favorite tea joke?
Sure. I like jokes.
Bring it!
Okay, well, I can't remember how it starts, but the punchline is "Leaf me alone. I'm bushed!"
Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells it.
Right.
Maybe that's because he remembers the whole thing.
It's nice to get a chance to relax a little.
It hardly ever happens.
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
So what's up?
If someone was captured by the Fire Nation, where would they be taken?
What do you mean? Who was captured?
When the invasion plan failed, some of our troops were taken.
I just want to know where they might be.
I can't tell you.
What? Why not?
Trust me. Knowing will just make you feel worse.
It's my dad. He was captured, too.
I need to know what I put him through.
It's not good, Sokka. Please.
My guess is they were taken to the Boiling Rock.
What's that?
The highest-security prison in the Fire Nation.
It's on an island in the middle of the boiling lake.
It's inescapable. So where is this place?
Why do you need to know? What are you planning?
Nothing.
Boy, you're so paranoid.
It's in the middle of a volcano between here and the Fire Nation.
You guys actually flew right past it on the way here.
Thanks, Zuko.
Just knowing makes me feel better.
Yeah, I'm sure it does.
Shh!
Not up to anything, huh?
Ahh!
Fine, you caught me.
I'm gonna rescue my dad. You happy now?
I'm never happy.
Look, I have to do this. The invasion plan was my idea.
It was my decision to stay when things were going wrong.
It's my mistake, and it's my job to fix it.
I have to regain my honor. You can't stop me, Zuko.
You need to regain your honor? Believe me, I get it.
I'm going with you.
No! I have to do this alone.
How are you going to get there? On Appa?
Last time I checked, prisons don't have bison daycares.
We'll take my war balloon.
What does it say?
"Need meat. Gone fishing.
"Back in a few days. Sokka and Zuko."
"One more thing.
"Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone.
"Do 20 sets of fire fists and 10 hop squats
"every time you hear a badger frog croak.
"Zuko."
Nobody else has homework.
One hop squat, two hop squat, three hop squat, four hop squat...
Pretty clouds.
Yeah, fluffy.
What?
What? Oh, I didn't say anything.
You know, a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons.
No kidding.
Yup. A balloon, but for war.
If there's one thing my dad's good at, it's war.
Yeah, it seems to run in the family.
Hey, hold on.
Not everyone in my family is like that.
I know, I know. You've changed.
I meant my uncle.
He was more of a father to me.
And I really let him down.
I think your uncle would be proud of you.
Leaving your home to come help us?
That's hard.
It wasn't that hard.
Really? You didn't leave behind anyone you cared about?
Well, I did have a girlfriend, Mai.
That gloomy girl who sighs a lot?
Yeah.
Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a traitor.
I couldn't drag her into it.
My first girlfriend turned into the moon.
That's rough, buddy.
There it is. Huh? Huh?
There's plenty of steam to keep us covered.
As long as we're quiet, we should be able to navigate through it without being caught.
We're going down.
The balloon's not working anymore.
The air outside is just as hot as the air inside, so we can't fly.
Whoa!
So what are we supposed to do?
I don't know. Crash landing?
How are we gonna get off the island if the balloon won't work?
We'll figure something out.
I suspected it might be a one-way ticket.
You knew this would happen and you wanted to come anyway?
My dad might be here. I had to come and see.
Uncle always said I never thought things through.
But this?
This is just crazy!
Hey, I never wanted you to come along in the first place.
And for the record, I always think things through.
But my plans haven't exactly worked.
So this time, I'm playing it by ear.
So there!
Aah!
What are you doing?
It doesn't work anyway, and we don't want anyone to find it.
I hope you know what you're doing.
There's no turning back now.
I hope these disguises work.
We just need to lay low and find my dad as soon as possible.
Guards! There's a scuffle in the yard.
Come on!
I didn't do anything. I'm going back to my cell.
Stop right there, Chit Sang!
We can't blow our cover.
I've had it with your unruly behavior.
What did I do?
He wants to know what he did. Isn't that cute?
Uh, yeah, very cute, sir. Super cute.
You didn't bow down when I walked by, Chit Sang.
What? That's not a prison rule.
Do it!
Make me.
Firebending is prohibited. You're goin' in the cooler.
You! Help me take him in.
Meet back here in an hour.
The warden will deal with you soon.
Can you believe this guy?
Prisoners! Am I right?
Tell me about it.
Ha-ha! Hey, new guy!
I know it's the rule to have your helmet on at all times, but this is the lounge.
Relax!
But what if there's an incident?
If I'm not prepared, someone could strike me on the head.
Give it a week. He'll loosen up.
Can the new guy ask you veterans a few questions about the prison?
No, you can't date the female guards.
Trust me, you don't want to.
No, that's not it.
The Boiling Rock.
It holds the Fire Nation's most dangerous criminals, right?
So what about war prisoners?
It sure looks cold in there.
That's why we call it the cooler.
He won't be firebending in there.
It's the warden! Look alive!
So, Chit Sang, I hear you used firebending to try to escape.
You should know better.
I wasn't trying to escape.
He's lying! I saw him with my own eyes.
No one has ever, ever escaped from here.
I'd sooner jump in the boiling lake myself than let that record fall.
Don't forget it.
Now go back to your shivering.
Hey, there, fellow guard. How goes it?
Zuko?
Shh!
Listen, I asked around the lounge.
There are no Water Tribe prisoners.
I'm afraid your father's not here.
What? Are you sure?
Did you double check?
Yeah, I'm sure.
No. No!
I'm really sorry, Sokka.
So we came all this way for nothing?
I failed... again.
Ah, what would Uncle say?
Sometimes clouds have two sides, a dark and light, and a silver lining in between.
It's like a silver sandwich.
So when life seems hard, take a bite out of the silver sandwich.
Maybe we haven't failed after all!
That's the spirit! I can't believe that worked.
I didn't even know what I was saying.
No, what you said made no sense at all.
But look!
It's Suki!
Prisoners! Back in your cells!
What is it? Did I do something wrong?
You mean you don't recognize me?
You people all look the same to me.
Oh? Then maybe you'll recognize this.
Sokka! It's you!
The other Kyoshi Warriors, are they here?
No. I don't know where they are.
They locked me in here, because I'm the leader.
Well, you won't be here for long. I'm busting you out.
I'm so glad to see you, Sokka. I knew you'd come.
Excuse me. I need to get into that cell.
No, you can't go in there.
The lights are out.
The prisoner could sneak up on you.
Step aside, fool!
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Guard, help! I think he's an imposter!
Aah! Arrest him!
Get him off me and arrest him!
You're under arrest!
Don't worry. I'll figure it out.
Well, well, well.
I never thought I'd find you in here, Prince Zuko.
How did you know who I am?
How could I not? You broke my niece's heart.
You're Mai's uncle?
I never meant to hurt her.
Quiet!
You're my special prisoner now. And you best behave.
If these criminals found out who you are, the traitor prince who let his nation down, why, they'd tear you to shreds.
So what's in it for you?
Why don't you just tell my father and collect a reward?
Oh, in due time, believe me. I intend to collect.
Oh, good. You guys have met.
Actually, we met a long time ago.
We did?
Yeah, you kinda burned down my village.
Oh, sorry about that. Nice to see you again.
So listen, I think I have an escape plan.
I checked out the coolers again.
The whole point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right?
Yeah.
So they're completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in.
Well, to keep the cold in, it also has to keep the heat out, right?
Just get to the point, Sokka.
It's a perfect boat for getting through the boiling water.
The cooler as a boat? Are you sure?
I'm telling you, it'll work.
I walked around the perimeter.
There's a blind spot between two guard towers.
It's the perfect launching point.
I already tested it out.
We'll roll the cooler into the water and just float with the current. It'll take us straight across.
As long as we don't make a sound, no one will notice.
And bing, bang, boom, we're home free!
But how are you gonna get the cooler out?
Yeah, how are you gonna get the cooler out?
What? We didn't... We didn't say that!
Yeah, you heard wrong.
I heard you hatching an escape plan, and I want in.
There's nothing to get in on.
Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is... an egg?
Okay, well, I come with you, or the warden hears about this egg, too.
I guess we have no choice.
Okay, you're in.
Now, first we need someone to unbolt the cooler from the inside.
Oh, I can get you inside.
Hey, what are you? Stupid?
Watch where you're going!
Hey, you watch who you're shoving!
I think you mean whom I'm shoving.
I need backup over here!
No firebending. Into the cooler!
I can take you back to your cell if you've learned your lesson.
Yes, I have. Completely.
I got Suki and Chit Sang out of their cells a few minutes ago.
They'll be waiting for us at the shore.
Someone's coming!
Yeah, new arrivals coming in at dawn.
Anybody interesting? Nah, just the usual.
Some robbers, couple of traitors, some war prisoners.
Though I did hear there might be a pirate.
No foolin'!
War prisoners. It could be your father.
I know.
Well, what should we do?
Are we going ahead with the plan or are we waiting another night?
I don't know.
Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom, all of our freedom, on the slim chance that my dad is gonna show up?
It's your call, Sokka.
Took you guys long enough.
This here's my girl and my best buddy.
They're coming, too.
Fine. Everybody in the cooler.
Let's go.
Are you sure you wanna go?
You're the one who said you wanted to redeem yourself, redeem your honor.
Rescuing your dad is your chance.
Your dad?
If I had just cut my losses at the invasion, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess.
Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits before you fail.
No, it's not.
Look, Sokka, you're going to fail a lot before things work out.
That's supposed to make me feel better?
Even though you'll probably fail over and over and over again...
Seriously, not helping. -...you have to try every time.
You can't quit because you're afraid you might fail.
Hey, if you two are done cuddling, can we get a move on?
No, I'm staying.
You guys go. You've been here long enough.
I'm not leaving without you, Sokka.
I'm staying, too.
Not me. I'm out.
Let's roll, baby.
We gave up our only chance of escaping.
I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake.
Ah, this current is so slow.
I can use this to paddle.
Guards, secure the perimeter and lock down the prisoners!
Now!
The plan failed! They're caught!
Get the fugitives and throw them in the cooler!
Uh, they are in a cooler, sir.
One that's bolted down and not floating in the water!
This is a lockdown! We have new prisoners arriving.
Everything must be completely secure.
The gondola's moving.
This is it.
If my dad's not there, we risked everything for nothing.
We had to.
Come on, come on!
Is that him?
My dad doesn't have a nose ring.
Where is he?
That's it? That can't be it.
I'm sorry, Sokka.
Oh, no!
Hey, you! Get off the gondola!
Dad.
