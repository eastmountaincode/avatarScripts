Water...
Earth...
Fire...
Air.
Long ago...
The four nations lived together in harmony.
Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.
Only the Avatar, master of all four elements could stop them.
But when the world needed him most he vanished.
100 years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar an airbender named Aang.
And although his airbending skills were great he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.
Oof.
But I believe Aang can save the world.
I am proud of you, Prince Zuko.
You slayed the Avatar.
You're so beautiful when you hate the world.
I don't hate you.
I don't hate you, too.
I have everything I always wanted.
But it's not at all how I thought it would be.
The Avatar is alive.
I want you to find him...
And end him.
I'm so excited to spend the weekend on Ember Island.
It's gonna be great to hang out on the beach and do nothing.
Doing nothing is a waste of time.
We're being sent away on a forced vacation.
I feel like a child.
Lighten up.
So dad wants to meet with his advisors alone without anyone else around.
Don't take it personally.
Doesn't your family have a house on Ember Island?
We used to come every summer when we were kids.
That must've been fun.
That was a long time ago.
Welcome to Ember Island, kids.
It smells like old lady in here.
Gee, I wonder why.
Who are these two beautiful women?
Can't you tell?
It's Li and me. It's Lo and me.
Ooh, I love this seashell bedspread.
Are you serious?
It looks like the beach threw up all over it.
We know you're upset that you were forced to come here this weekend.
But Ember Island is a magical place.
Keep an open mind.
Give it a chance.
And it can help you understand yourselves and each other.
The beach has a special way of smoothing even the most ragged edges.
Time to hit the beach.
Aang, I know swimming is fun and all but do you really think you should be exposing yourself like that?
Cover up.
What? I'm wearing trunks.
I know, it's your tattoos I'm worried about.
What if someone sees you?
There are walls all around us.
It's completely safe.
Whoo, hey!
This has got to be the most boring job in the Fire Nation.
Nothing ever happens.
Whoa!
Let's go again.
The Avatar's alive.
We better send a messenger hawk to the Fire Lord.
A black ribbon message.
This is so exciting.
Ahh!
Hey, you need some help unpacking?
Sure, thanks.
Could you scooch just a little bit more to the...
Perfect.
Here...
This is for you.
Why would I want that?
I saw it and I thought it was pretty.
Don't girls like stuff like this?
Maybe stupid girls.
Forget it!
Wow, thanks.
This is so pretty.
Not as pretty as you are.
That shell's not so great.
Ahem, shade... Shade.
I thought since it's so hot... Here.
Thanks.
This is really refreshing.
Hey, beach bums, we're playing next.
Ty lee, get over here now.
See that girl with the silly pigtails?
When she runs towards the ball there's just the slightest hesitation of her left foot.
I'm willing to bet a childhood injury has weakened her.
Keep serving the ball to her left and we'll destroy her and the rest of her team.
Dismissed.
Yes, we defeated you for all time.
You will never rise from the ashes of your shame and humiliation.
Well, that was fun.
I'm having a party tonight.
You should come by.
Sure...
I love parties.
Your friend can come, too.
Uh, what about me and my brother?
Aren't you going to invite us?
You don't know who we are, do you?
Don't you know who we are?
We're Chan and Ruon-Jian.
Yeah.
But fine, you're invited.
Just so you know, though some of the most important teenagers in the Fire Nation are gonna be at this party so...
Try and act normal.
We'll do our best.
Why didn't you tell those guys who we were?
I guess I was intrigued.
I'm so used to people worshipping us.
They should.
Yes, I know, and I love it.
But for once, I just wanted to see how people would treat us if they didn't know who we were.
Like waves washing away the footprints on the sand Ember island gives everyone a clean slate.
Ember Island reveals the true you.
To the party. To the party.
Um... You're a little early.
No one's here yet.
I heard you telling someone.
You'd be partying from dusk till dawn.
It's dusk so we're here.
But that's just an expression.
We are the perfect party guests.
We arrive right on time because we are very punctual.
All right, listen, my dad's an admiral.
He has no idea I'm having this party so don't mess anything up.
That's a sharp outfit, Chan... Careful.
You could puncture the hull of an Empire-class Fire Nation battleship leaving thousands to drown at sea...
Because it's so sharp.
Um... Thanks.
Hey, first ones here, huh?
He thinks he's so great.
Well, what do you think of him?
I don't have any opinion about him.
I hardly know him.
You like him, don't you?
So how do you know Ty Lee?
I met her at the beach today.
She was pretty impressed by a sand pagoda that I made for her.
Well, I met her first.
Look, it doesn't matter who I met first 'cause I like you all.
But which one of us do you like?
Yeah. Tell us.
I don't know, I don't know.
Ooh.
Ahh...
Oh, I'm glad you're here.
Those boys won't leave me alone.
I guess they all just like me too much.
Come on, Ty Lee, you can't be this ignorant.
What are you talking about?
Those boys only like you because you make it so easy for them.
You're not a challenge-you're a tease.
It's not like they actually care who you are.
OK, OK, calm down.
I didn't mean what I said.
Look, maybe I just said it because I was a little...
Jealous.
What?
You were jealous of me?
Um, but, you're the most beautiful, smartest, perfect girl in the world.
Well, you're right about all those things.
But for some reason when I meet boys they act as if I'm going to do something horrible to them.
But you probably would do something horrible to them.
I'm sure they're just intimidated by you.
OK, look, if you want a boy to like you just look at him and smile a lot and laugh at everything he says even if it's not funny.
Well, that sounds really shallow and stupid.
Let's try it.
OK.
"Hey, there, sweet sugar cakes."
"How ya likin' this party?"
I'm bored. ZUKO: I know.
I'm hungry. So what?
So find me some food.
Sure.
Chan, I'm ready for a tour of the house.
Is this your first time on Ember Island?
No, I used to come here years ago.
It's a great place if you like sand.
Yeah, it's like, "Welcome to Sandy Land."
Your arms look so strong.
Yeah, I know.
You're pretty.
Together, you and I will be...
The strongest couple in the entire world.
We will dominate the earth!
Uh... I gotta go.
Hey, watch it.
That food was for my cranky girlfriend.
Whoa...
What are you doing?
Stop talking to my girlfriend.
Relax, it's just a party.
Uh!
Zuko, what is wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
Your temper's out of control.
You blow up over every little thing.
You're so impatient and hot-headed and angry.
Well, at least I feel something... As opposed to you.
You have no passion for anything.
You're just a big blah.
It's over, Zuko.
We're done.
Who broke my Nana's vase?
That's it, you're out of here.
I was just leaving.
Have fun by yourself, loser boy.
Nice.
Guys, you're all gonna think I'm crazy but it feels like a metal man is coming.
I thought I'd find you here.
Those summers we spent here seem so long ago.
So much has changed.
Come down to the beach with me.
Come on, this place is depressing.
Hey...
Where's your new boyfriend?
Are you cold?
I'm freezing.
I'll make a fire.
There's plenty of stuff to burn in there.
This is crazy.
How can we beat a guy who blows things up with his mind?
We can.
Jump on Appa.
I'll try to distract him.
I'm OK.
Well, that was random.
I don't think so.
I get the feeling he knows who we are.
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing.
But it's a painting of your family.
You think I care?
I think you do.
You don't know me, so why don't you just mind your own business?
Ah, I know you.
No, you don't.
You're stuck in your little Ty Lee world where everything's great all the time.
Zuko, leave her alone.
I'm so pretty, look at me.
I can walk on my hands, whoo!
Circus freak.
Yes, I'm a circus freak.
Go ahead and laugh all you want.
You wanna know why I joined the circus?
Here we go.
Do you have any idea what my home life was like growing up with six sisters who look exactly like me?
It was like, I didn't even have my own name.
I joined the circus because I was scared of spending the rest of my life as part of a matched set.
At least, I'm different now.
Circus freak is a compliment.
Guess that explains why you need 10 boyfriends, too.
I'm sorry, what?
Attention issues?
You couldn't get enough attention when you were a kid so you're trying to make up for it now.
Well, what's your excuse, Mai?
You were an only child for 15 years.
But even with all that attention your aura is this dingy, pasty, gray...
I don't believe in auras.
Yeah, you don't believe in anything.
Oh, well, I'm sorry I can't be as high-strung and crazy as the rest of you.
I'm sorry, too.
I wish you would be high-strung and crazy for once instead of keeping all your feelings bottled up inside.
She just called your aura dingy.
Are you gonna take that?
What do you want from me?
You want a teary confession about how hard my childhood was?
Well, it wasn't.
I was a rich only child who got anything I wanted as long as I behaved...
And sat still and didn't speak unless spoken to.
My mother said I had to keep out of trouble.
We had my dad's political career to think about.
Well, that's it, then.
You had a controlling mother who had certain expectations and if you strayed from them you were shut down.
That's why you're afraid to care about anything and why you can't express yourself.
You want me to express myself?
Leave me alone!
I like it when you express yourself.
Don't touch me.
I'm still mad at you.
My life hasn't been that easy, either, Mai.
Whatever. That doesn't excuse the way you've been acting.
Calm down, you guys.
This much negative energy is bad for your skin.
You'll totally break out.
Bad skin?
Normal teenagers worry about bad skin.
I don't have that luxury.
My father decided to teach me a permanent lesson on my face.
Sorry, Zuko, I...
For so long, I thought that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy.
I'm back home, now.
My dad talks to me.
Huh, he even thinks I'm a hero.
Everything should be perfect, right?
I should be happy now, but I'm not.
I'm angrier than ever and I don't know why.
There's a simple question you need to answer then.
Who are you angry at?
No one, I'm just angry.
Yeah, who are you angry at, Zuko?
Everyone... I don't know.
Is it Dad?
No, no.
Your uncle? Me?
No, no... No, no.
Then who?
Who are you angry at?
Answer the question, Zuko.
Talk to us.
Come on, answer the question.
Come on, answer it.
I'm angry at myself.
Why?
Because I'm confused.
Because I'm not sure I know the difference between right and wrong anymore.
You're pathetic.
I know one thing I care about...
I care about you.
Well, those were wonderful performances, everyone.
I guess you wouldn't understand, would you, Azula because you're just so perfect.
Well, yes, I guess you're right.
I don't have sob stories like all of you.
I could sit here and complain how our mom liked Zuko more than me but I don't really care.
My own mother...
Thought I was a monster.
She was right, of course, but it still hurt.
What Lo and Li said came true.
The beach did help us learn about ourselves.
I feel all smoothed.
I'll always remember this.
You know what would make this trip really memorable?
We've got some bad news, Chan.
Party's over.
