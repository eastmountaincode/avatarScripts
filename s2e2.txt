KATARA: Water...
Earth...
Fire...
Air.
Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.
Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.
Only the Avatar, master of all 4 elements, could stop them.
But when the world needed him most, he vanished.
100 years passed, And my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...
An airbender named Aang.
And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.
AANG: Oof!
KATARA: But I believe Aang can save the world.
SOKKA: You guys are gonna be done soon, right?
We've got a lot of ground to cover If we want to make it to Omashu today.
What, like you're ready to go right now, naked guy?
I could be ready in two minutes.
Seriously. Whenever.
So, you were showing me the octopus form.
Right. Let me see your stance.
Your arms are too far apart.
See, if you move them closer together, you protect your center.
-You got it? -Oh. Yeah.
Thanks.
OK, let's see what you got.
You make a fine octopus, pupil Aang.

Hey, hey! River people.
We're not river people.
You're not?
Well, then what kind of people are you?
Just people.
Aren't we all, brother? Hoo!
Who are you?
I'm Chong.
And this is my wife, Lily.
We're nomads.
Happy to go wherever the wind takes us.
[SINGS GIBBERISH]
You guys are nomads?!
That's great! I'm a nomad!
Hey! Me, too!
I know.
You just said that.
Oh. Nice underwear.
[GASPS]
[GRUNTING]
I didn't find anything to eat.
I can't live like this.
I wasn't meant to be a fugitive.
This is impossible!
Uncle...
What are you doing?
You're looking at the rare white dragon bush.
Its leaves make a tea so delicious it's heartbreaking.
That, or it's the white jade bush, which is poisonous.
We need food, not tea.
I'm going fishing.
Hmm. Delectable tea, or deadly poison?
[LOWING]
AANG: Hey, Sokka, You should hear some of these stories.
These guys have been everywhere.
Well, not everywhere, little arrowhead, but where we haven't been, we've heard about through stories and songs.
They said they'll take us to see a giant night crawler.
MOKU: On the way, there's a waterfall that creates a never-ending rainbow!
Look, I hate to be the wet blanket here, but since Katara is busy, I guess it's up to me.
We need to get to Omashu.
No sidetracks, no worms, and definitely no rainbows.
Whoa! Sounds like someone's got a case of destination fever.
[LAUGHS]
You're worried too much about where you're going.
LILY: You gotta focus less on the where and more on the going.
Oh...
Ma...
Shu!
Sokka's right.
We need to find King Bumi so Aang can learn earthbending somewhere safe.
Well, sounds like you're headed to Omashu.
There's an old story about a secret pass...
Right through the mountains.
Is this real or a legend?
Oh, it's a real legend.
And it's as old as earthbending itself.

I think we'll just stick with flying.

We'll be fine.
Yeah, thanks for the help, but Appa hates going underground.
And we need to do whatever makes Appa most comfortable.
[LOWING]
Launch!
[SNARLING]
[SCREAMING]
Secret love cave. Let's go.
IROH: Zuko, remember that plant I thought might be tea?
You didn't.
I did.
And it wasn't.
Aagh!
When the rash spreads to my throat, I will stop breathing.
But look what I found!
These are pakui berries.
Known to cure the poison of the white jade plant!
That, or makaola berries, that cause blindness.
We're not taking any more chances with these plants!
We need to get help.
But where are we going to go?
We're enemies of the Earth Kingdom, and fugitives from the Fire Nation.
If the Earth Kingdom discovers us, they'll have us killed.
But if the Fire Nation discovers us, We'll be turned over to Azula.
Earth kingdom it is.
SOKKA: How far are we from the tunnel?
Actually, it's not just one tunnel.
The lovers didn't want anyone to find out about their love, so they built a whole labyrinth.
Labyrinth?!
I'm sure we'll figure it out.
All you need to do is trust in love, according to the curse.
[GROWLS]
Curse?!
CHONG: Hey, hey! We're here!
SOKKA: What exactly is this curse?
The curse says that only those that trust in love can make it through the caves.
Otherwise, you'll be trapped in them forever.
And die.
Oh, yeah, and die.
Hey!
I just remembered the rest of that song.
[STRUMS] ♪ And die ♪ That's it! There's no way we're going through some cursed hole!
Hey! Someone's making a big campfire!
That's no campfire, Moku.
It's Fire Nation.
They're tracking us.
So, all you need is to trust in love to get through these caves?
That is correct, Master Arrowhead.
We can make it.
Everyone into the hole.
[SNARLS]
SOLDIER: Hold on!
It's too dangerous.
Haven't you heard the song?
Just close them in.
The mountain will take care of the rest.
[GROWLING]
KATARA: It's OK, Appa. We'll be fine.
I hope.
We will be fine.
All we need is a plan.
Chong, how long do those torches last?
Um, about two hours each.
And we have five torches, so that's 10 hours.
It doesn't work like that if they're all lit at the same time!
Oh! Right.
I'm gonna make a map to keep track of exactly where we've been.
Then we should be able to solve it like a maze and get through.
[APPA GROWLS]
WOMAN: You two must not be from around here.
We know better than to touch the white jade.
Much less make it into tea and drink it.
[LAUGHS] Oops!
-So, where are you traveling from? -Yes, we're travelers.
Do you have names?
Names?
Of course we have names.
I'm... Lee.
And this is my uncle...
Uh, Mushi.
Yes, my nephew was named after his father, so just call him Junior.
Mushi and Junior, huh?
My name is Song.
You two look like you could use a good meal.
Why don't you stay for dinner?
Sorry, but we need to be moving on.
That's too bad.
My mom always makes too much roast duck.
Where do you live exactly?!
Sokka, this is the tenth dead end you've led us to.
This doesn't make any sense. We already came through this way.
CHONG: We don't need a map.
We just need love.
The little guy knows it.
Yeah, but I wouldn't mind a map, also.
SOKKA: There's something strange here.
There's only one explanation.
The tunnels are changing.
[RUMBLING]
[CHITTERING]
My daughter tells me you're refugees.
We were once refugees ourselves.
When I was a little girl, the Fire Nation raided our farming village.
All the men were taken away.
That was the last time I saw my father.
I haven't seen my father in many years.
Oh. Is he fighting in the war?
Yeah.
CHONG: The tunnels...
They're a-changing.
It must be the curse.
I knew we shouldn't have come down here.
Right. If only we'd listened to you.
KATARA: Everyone be quiet. Listen!

AANG: We found the exit!
[STRAINING]
[APPA GROWLS]
[SCREAMING]
This isn't the exit.
No.
It's a tomb.
AANG: It must be the two lovers from the legend.
That's who is buried here.
These pictures tell their story.
KATARA: They met on top of the mountain that divided their two villages.
The villages were enemies, so they could not be together.
But their love was strong, and they found a way.
The two lovers learned earthbending from the badger-moles.
They became the first earthbenders.
They built elaborate tunnels so that they could meet secretly.
Anyone who tried to follow them would be lost forever in the labyrinth.
But one day, the man didn't come.
He died in the war between their two villages.
Devastated, the woman unleashed a terrible display of her earthbending power.
She could have destroyed them all...
But instead she declared the war over.
Both villages helped her build a new city where they would live together in peace.
The woman's name was Oma, and the man's name was Shu.
The great city was named Omashu as a monument to their love.
"Love is brightest in the dark."
MOKU: Oh, great!
Your plans have led us to another dead end.
SOKKA: At least I'm thinking of ideas and trying to get is out of here, Moku.
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
We're thinking of ideas?
'Cause I've had an idea for, like, an hour now.
Yes!
We're all thinking of ideas!
Well, then listen to this.
If love is the key out of here, then all we need to do is play a love song.
[STRUMMING]
AANG: How are we gonna find our way out of these tunnels?
I have a crazy idea.
What?
Never mind. It's too crazy.
Katara, what is it?
I was thinking...
The curse says we'll be trapped in here forever unless we trust in love.
Right.
And here it says "love is brightest in the dark"
And has a picture of them kissing.
Where are you going with this?
Well...
What if we kissed?
Us, kissing?
See? It was a crazy idea.
Us...
Kissing.
[SCOFFS]
Us, kissing. What was I thinking?!
Can you imagine that?
Yeah. [LAUGHS AWKWARDLY]
I definitely wouldn't want to kiss you.
Oh. Well, I didn't realize it was such a horrible option.
Sorry I suggested it.
No, no. I mean...
If it was a choice between kissing you and dying...
-Oh! -What?!
I'm saying I would rather kiss you than die. That's a compliment.
Well, I'm not sure which I would rather do.
What is wrong with me?
