KATARA: Water.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.
Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.
Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.
But when the world needed him most, he vanished.
A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang.
And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.
AANG: Oof.
But I believe Aang can save the world.
MAN: Previously on Avatar...
I came along because I wanted to make sure you got through the Serpent's Pass safely.
But now I need to get back to the other Kyoshi Warriors.
You stole Appa.
Where is he, what did you do to him?
I traded him.
He's probably in Ba Sing Se by now.
AANG: He's here, I can feel it.
I am Long Feng, head of the Dai Li.
I understand you've been looking for your bison, it would be quite a shame if you were not able to complete your quest.
APPA: [RUMBLING]
No, stop sinking!
[GROWLING]
[GRUNTING]
Whoa! Augh.
[SCREAMING]
[ROARING]
Don't make me put this down!
MAN: Put a muzzle on it!
Augh, oof!
Augh!
[ROARING]
MEN: [GRUNTING]
I'm sorry, Appa.
APPA: [RUMBLING]
MAN: Ransack his saddle.
Who knows what treasures are stashed in there?
[ROARING]
He's tied up good, he can't hurt you.
[SNIFFING]
[SNEEZING]
What's your father gonna do when he finds out we lost a sandsailer?
Nothing.
It's the one we stole from the Hammi Tribe.
Did you empty the saddle?
That's it?
Nothing but garbage!
Ah, doesn't matter.
We'll still make a profit from selling him to those beetle-headed merchants.
[RUMBLING]
How's his temper?
Uh, pretty good.
[ROARING]
[LAUGHING NERVOUSLY] Most of the time.
I bet someone will pay a fortune for him in Ba Sing Se.
All right, you've got a deal.
AANG: Appa!
Appa!
[GRUNTING]
He's your problem now! [LAUGHING]
What?
MAN: Whoa!
We need the shirshu spit darts!
Got 'em.
OK, big fella, You're gonna take a nice, little snoozle.
[SHOUTING] Appa!
No.
[SHOUTING] No!
[RUMBLING]
We've gotta get rid of this one.
He's too much trouble.
We could sell him for parts.
[RUMBLING]
Oh, I understand you've had a rather hard time, lately.
That's too bad.
You probably felt you had no choice but to behave outrageously.
Like a wild animal.
But don't worry, you won't anymore.
Because I am going to break you.
APPA: [RUMBLING]
[RUMBLING]
[SQUAWKING]
Hungry?
Don't worry, I'm going to feed you too.
But not yet.
First I'm going to show you how you'll earn it.
[SQUAWKING]
[SQUAWKING]
Of course, when you perform, the hoops will be flaming.
And if you are careful, you won't get burned.
[BURPING]
You're about to be sorry.
[ROARING]
It's obvious that whoever your previous owner was, he had no idea how to handle you properly.
[CIRCUS MUSIC PLAYING]
I'm gonna go get a bag of sizzle-crisps.
Stay here and stay away from that monster!
Behave yourself or you'll regret it.
[RUMBLING]
He's a difficult creature, stubborn and willful.
I need more time with him.
It's too risky right now.
Too risky?
What're you talking about?
This is the circus, home of fear and danger!
I want the wind buffalo to perform tonight.
If you don't behave yourself...
You'll regret it.
[ROARING]
Let's go!
See you later, buddy.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, now for something truly special.
A noble beast so magnificent and rare, it hasn't been seen by human eyes in generations.
I give you...
The wind buffalo!
[LAUGHTER]
Up.
[LAUGHTER]
Up, you insolent cow!
[ROARING]
Run away, get away from him!
AUDIENCE: Whoa, amazing, fabulous!
Augh!
Ugh.
[LAUGHTER]
[ROARING]
Go.
You can do it.
Get back here, you stupid beast!
AUDIENCE: Oh...
[GROANING]
[ROARING]
[SNIFFING]

[PURRING]
WOMAN: Choose well.
A sky bison is a companion for life.
[GRUNTING]
I guess this means we'll always be together.
[LAUGHING]
Always.
MAN: [SCREAMING] It's some kind of monster!
[GROWLING]
[ROARING]
[SCREAMING]

[GASPING]
Uncle, what are you looking at?
Is there something out there?
Muh, it's nothing.
Go back to sleep.

[BIRDS CHIRPING]
Must've been some fight.
Wait, let me see that.
No, it couldn't be.
[GASPING] Appa?
Oh, no.
[GROWLING]
It's gonna be O.K., Appa.
I have to leave, but I'm gonna be back soon with help.
No sudden movements.
He's been lost for a while, and he looks like he's hurt.
He's shy around people and scared.
Stay low and stay quiet.
I can't believe you found the Avatar's bison.
Didn't you just see the Avatar a few days go?
Yes, so he can't be too far from here.
It's our responsibility to get Appa back to him safely.
This could be our most important mission yet.
[GROWLING]
Give him some space!
Appa, it's me, Suki.
I'm a friend.
[RUMBLING]
I want to help you.
You're hurt.
We can help you feel better.
[RUMBLING]
And we can help you find Aang.
[ROARING]
My, my, you're easy to find.
It's really astounding my brother hasn't captured you yet.
[GROWLING]
[GROWLING]
What do you want with us?
Who are you, the Avatar's fan girls?
Oh, I get it!
Good one, Azula.
If you're looking for the Avatar, you're out of luck.
AZULA: [SIGHING] I knew this was a waste of time.
No Avatar, huh?
Well, that's O.K.
Any friend of the Avatar...
Is an enemy of mine!
Augh! Uh, huh?
You're so colorful, it's making me nauseous.
Ugh, ugh, ugh!
You're not prettier than we are.
[GROWLING]
Afraid of fire, I see?
That's good, you should be.
Go, Appa! Fly away from here!
[GRUNTING]
[GROWLING]
Get out of here!
You have to find Aang!
We'll be O.K.
Don't you know fans just make flames stronger?

[GASPING]
Hello.
I am Guru Pathik.
[RUMBLING CONFUSEDLY]
I know I'm not the person you expected.
And I didn't expect to be licked by a giant tongue just now.
[SIGHING] the world is full of surprises.
[GROWLING]
[GROWLING]
Oh, dear.
You've been through so much, recently.
Hurt and betrayed.
So twisted-up inside.
You're still full of love.
[SIGHING] but fear has moved in where trust should be.
I've been expecting you and the young Avatar for quite a long time.
I had a vision many years ago of helping him.
That's why I came to the Eastern Air Temple.
Oh, your emotions are so turbulent.
Like swirling storm clouds.
Let the clouds in your mind be gentle, peaceful ones.
Someone looks very well-rested, judging by your bed head.
[ROARING]
I have prepared a message for Aang.
May I attach it to your horn?
[RUMBLING]
You and the Avatar's energies are mixed.
You have an unbreakable bond.
By reading your energy, I can sense where Aang is.
Funny, what invisible strings connect us all.
I'll see you again, great beast.
